### Objective

ODP loopback demo on HiSilicon devices. An odp app sends icmp packets to x86, which loops them back and confirms transmission.

### Description


The ODP packet IO APIs have been implemented on D01, and will be implemented on D02 this year. D02 has max 32 Cortex A57 cores, 8 DDR3 slots, 2 x 1GE ports, and 2 x 10GE SFP+ ports. It is designed as a high performance board for heavy-load scenario.
