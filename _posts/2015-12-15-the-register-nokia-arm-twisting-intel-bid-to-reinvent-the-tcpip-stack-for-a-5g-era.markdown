<blockquote markdown="1">
Nokia and ARM are at the heart of [a bid to revamp the ageing TCP/IP stack](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/12/08/nokia_arm_enea_craft_tcpip_stack_for_the_cloud/) to make it better suited to networks that need to operate at very high speed and/or low latency. Among the plethora of industry alliances at the intersection of telecoms, IT and IP, this looks like one with a genuine contribution to make to the evolution of future standards, including 5G.
...
Nokia says it will meet the “stringent requirements for core and radio applications in the cloud”, unlike older implementations, and this may be its key differentiator. The stack is will be optimized for ODP (Open Data Plane) programming interfaces, which enables hardware acceleration of the fast-paths, and allows the protocol to be programmable via the ODP environment. This will be important to cloud applications and to communications processing on bare metal switches in an SDN world.
