Dear Community Friends,

I received confirmation this morning from Linaro Connect (LCU14) organizers that registering for LCU14 using the code: "DEMO-THUR" will allow participants to join us at Connect on Thursday September 18th for demos and some sessions - at no charge! (In order to offer this for free, participants using this code will be on their own for lunch and will not receive any Linaro Connect materials.)

This is a great opportunity to share the "DEMO-THUR" code with interested parties such as: management, engineering, customers, suppliers, etc. and to encourage them to register and join us at Connect to see all the great work going on in ODP (OpenDataPlane.org) and Linaro in general.

Those interested in attending more of Linaro Connect, receiving meals, materials, etc. should sign up at the Connect website without using this special code.

For anyone needing housing, there's a discounted rate for accommodation at the LCU14 event hotel ([Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport Hotel](http://sanfranciscoairport.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html) [1]) of US$179. You can benefit from this promotional rate by booking through the Connect accommodation webpage, but the promotional price is subject to availability and only available through the end of August.

If you have any questions regarding accommodation or registration please visit the [Linaro Connect website](https://connect.linaro.org/lcu14/). [2]
