There are now two interactive versions of the ODP Roadmap for 2015 Q3 and Q4 published to the [website](http://opendataplane.org///opendataplane-roadmap/). The data for the roadmaps is imported from the OpenDataPlane project in Jira. It will be updated occasionally (2-3 times during a release cycle) and is NOT LIVE synchronized with JIRA. The tools are quite useful for visualizing feature delivery by versions and time. The _swimlane_ version of the roadmap displays only the _epics_ (agile - big stories) currently being worked on. The _timeline_ version includes all features (epics; stories not shown), initiatives (themes, mandate), and some important industry trade shows. Let us know what you think.

Check them out below:
