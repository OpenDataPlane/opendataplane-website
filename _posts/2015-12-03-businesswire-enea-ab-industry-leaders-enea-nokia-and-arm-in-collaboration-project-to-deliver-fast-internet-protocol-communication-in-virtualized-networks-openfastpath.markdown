Enea AB (STO:ENEA)

Enea® (NASDAQ OMX Nordic:ENEA), Nokia Networks and ARM today announced the launch of the OpenFastPath (OFP) project. OFP delivers the first open-source, user space based, fast-path TCP/IP stack, which can be deployed across hardware architectures, allowing use of the most suitable hardware for any specific workload. The first OFP software release is already available for download at [www.openfastpath.org](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.openfastpath.org&esheet=51236676&newsitemid=20151203005797&lan=en-US&anchor=www.openfastpath.org&index=1&md5=861cef7254d87c5a9590a96f9ed46c73).

OFP operates as a non-profit foundation, with the goal to create a healthy and sustainable open source community where participants contribute their own code and technologies that facilitate more efficient networking solutions, leverage hardware acceleration, and lower the barriers to building network applications in multivendor environments.

Enea’s strategic direction towards the COSNOS (Carrier-grade Open Source Networking Operating System) implies playing a leading role in relevant industry collaboration initiatives.

“As co-founder of and contributor to the OFP project, we help bringing amazing functions to the connected society”, said Daniel Forsgren, SVP Product Management, Enea. “But we also complement the OFP mission in a very hands-on way, through tailored services, or as packaged open source software and services delivered as a product.”

In addition to the three founding members Enea, Nokia Networks and ARM, the OFP project is supported by several industry players including Cavium, Freescale, HP, and Linaro. Please find them all at the following link: [www.openfastpath.org](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.openfastpath.org&esheet=51236676&newsitemid=20151203005797&lan=en-US&anchor=www.openfastpath.org&index=2&md5=bd1f0567dcbd7f1f5479b390c4caf2c1).
